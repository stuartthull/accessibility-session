            <p><b style={{fontSize:'24px'}}>This is about the 718 Cayman</b></p>
            <p>Porsche has always been careful not to let its 718 Cayman get too potent and potentially tread on the toes of the iconic 911. But as that car moves steadily upmarket and gets more expensive the Cayman’s leash has been progressively loosened, with faster, more aggressive models like the GTS 4.0, the GT4 and – at last – this new GT4 RS.</p>
            <p><b style={{fontSize:'24px'}}>This is about the twilight years of the Porsche engine</b></p>
            <p>As the internal combustion engine enters its twilight years Porsche is clearly determined to see it go out with style, and has taken the incredible, non-turbocharged 4.0-litre six-cylinder engine from the 911 GT3 and put it into the Cayman. On paper that looks pretty similar to the comparable motor in the GTS 4.0 and GT4 but this is a totally different beast, the extra 80 horsepower taking the peak output to 500 horsepower all delivered at a screaming 9,000rpm redline. It drives through a standard ‘PDK’ automatic gearbox, features extensive weight-saving measures (including a titanium roll cage) and a huge rear wing, the optional Weissach Package taking this further with additional carbon panels and the option of ultra-lightweight magnesium wheels.</p>

            <p><b style={{fontSize:'24px'}}>Reliability of a Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport</b></p>
            <p>“The components are all tried, tested and race proven and it’s built to the same high standards as any other car wearing the badge”</p>
            <p>Many racing cars are converted from regular road cars, with varying degrees of expertise and success. This often means stripping out wiring and interiors, changing engines and suspension and any number of other things that could potentially go wrong. But the Cayman GT4 Clubsport is built from the ground-up as a pure racing car, with all Porsche’s long motorsport expertise supporting it. As such the components are all tried, tested and race proven and it’s built to the same high standards as any other car wearing the badge. The fact you can just turn the key and go racing has huge appeal in reliability terms.</p>

            <p><b style={{fontSize:'24px'}}>Safety for a Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport</b></p>
            <p>“Because the Clubsport is built from the start as a racing car it’s therefore safer than others that have been converted at a later date”</p>
            <p>In road cars modern safety systems are designed to stop you having a crash in the first place, but in racing the technology is more about accepting that accidents do happen and, when they do, they will often be at higher speeds than your average parking ding. Because the Clubsport is built from the start as a racing car it’s therefore safer than others that have been converted at a later date, with a sturdy roll cage welded rather than bolted into the structure, an FIA-approved safety seat, six-point harness and the plumbed in fire extinguisher and electrical cut-offs demanded by competition regulations. There’s no escaping motorsport can be a dangerous activity but the Cayman is a safe place to go racing, and even has the road car’s traction control and a variable anti-lock brake system you can tune according to the conditions and track you’re competing on.</p>
            <p><b style={{fontSize:'24px'}}>The all important speed of the Porsche 718 Cayman GT4</b></p>
            <p>It’s quicker by every measure against the GT4 but the one stat the geeks will be looking at will be its laptime around the legendary Nürburgring circuit in Germany and here the RS model’s track focus is clear, its 7min 04sec time a staggering 22 seconds quicker than the GT4 and up there with the very fastest supercars.</p>
            <p><b style={{fontSize:'24px'}}>This is about combustion engines</b></p>
            <p>If you were promising yourself one last hit of internal combustion-engined thrills before the switch to electric it’s safe to say this GT4 RS should probably be at the top of your list.</p>
